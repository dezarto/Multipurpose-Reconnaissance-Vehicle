# Project Title: Multipurpose Reconnaissance Vehicle

## Project Description
This project encompasses a Multipurpose Reconnaissance Vehicle designed for versatile exploration on the surface of the planet. The vehicle is equipped with various sensors and communication antennas to monitor diverse features and atmospheric conditions on the planet. Additionally, it includes a set of sensors to assess environmental conditions and respond to specific tasks.

## Key Features
1. **Communication Antennas:**
   - The vehicle is equipped with two communication antennas.
   - The control center is equipped with two communication antennas.
   - Antenna 1 and Antenna 2 establish 1-to-1 communication between the vehicle and the control center.
   - Antenna 3 and Antenna 4 communicate with other remote sensors or exploration equipment.

2. **Soil Moisture Sensor (SOIL SENSOR):**
   - Measures soil moisture levels on the planet surface.
   - Used for analyzing the potential for plant growth and assessing local environmental conditions.

3. **Motion Sensor:**
   - Detects movements in the vehicle's surroundings.
   - Identifies potential hazards and takes safety measures.

4. **Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT11):**
   - Measures temperature and humidity levels in the planet atmosphere.
   - Evaluates atmospheric conditions and optimizes the vehicle's operational parameters.

5. **Gas Detection Sensor (MQ-3):**
   - Detects specific gases in the planet atmosphere.
   - Identifies potential hazardous gases and sends precautions to the control center.

6. **Water Level Sensor (WATER SENSOR):**
   - Measures precipitation on the planet surface.
   - Used for detecting water and precipitation, assessing the potential presence of liquid water.

7. **Light Detection Sensor (LDR):**
   - Measures light levels on the planet surface.
   - Monitors day and night conditions and optimizes the vehicle's energy management.

## Project Objectives
- Monitor and analyze environmental conditions on the planet surface.
- Detect potential precipitations.
- Collect and assess atmospheric data.
- Ensure safety by monitoring movements in the vehicle's surroundings.
- Maintain continuous communication with the control center through communication antennas.
